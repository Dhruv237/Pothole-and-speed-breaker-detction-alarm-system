# Pothole-and-speed-breaker-detction-alarm-system
The objective behind this project is to
enhance road safety by addressing the
common issues of accidents and
vehicle damage caused by potholes and
speed breakers. By developing a
precise real-time detection system, the
project aims to offer a simple and
effective solution. The focus is on
creating a system that is accessible,
understandable, and immediately
actionable, promoting safer driving
experiences for everyone.
Functionalities
➢ Detection of potholes, speed
breakers or broken roads in realtime.
➢ Generates audible or visual alerts to
warn the driver when a pothole or
speed breaker is detected.
Th project is made in follwing steps:-
1)creating dataset of lots of images
2)labelling images
3)Training done using yolov8 on 50 epochs and obtaining best.pt model
4)predicting on the videos/images and generating audio alerts.
